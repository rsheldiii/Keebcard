# The KeebCard, an open-source, low-power, mechanical switch computer keychain

![Prototype KeebCard picture](Media/KeebCard.jpg)

This is the home of the KeebCard project. Originally designed as a business card, people loved it so much I decided to release a version of it as open-source (TODO: add a license).

The KeebCard is centered around an SSD1306-powered 128x32 monochromatic display and an ATTINY85-10SU. The code uses the wonderful [Tiny4kOLED library](https://github.com/datacute/Tiny4kOLED) to communicate with the screen via i2c. With 8 kilobytes of program space and 512 bytes of RAM, it's a fun challenge getting anything to run on this thing!

# OpenSaucers

OpenSauce attendees, thanks for supporting TheKeebProject! Check out the DIY assembly video below. The amount of components present in the bag indicates what they are; there is one capacitor, two i2c resistors (on the back) and four pull-up resistors. The assembly video should go over everything, if you have any trouble get in touch!

## Case Assembly (Button and LowPro)

Watch [this quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVERQCmgONw) if you want to know how to use the cases! Especially important for button cases, they can be tricky

# Flashing/Code

At the base of this project (currently) is the code that runs on the machine, you can `git clone` or download zip and open the KeebCard.ino file in Arduino. I don't normally program in C++, so it's a little rough. You can change what program is flashed by changing the define at the top of KeebCard.ino.

The KeebCard code is currently compiled and flashed with an ISP programmer via the Arduino suite. [check out the flashing tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kj1aFIwNek)

### A note about dependencies

Currently, all dependencies can be installed via the Arduino library manager, check out the flashing tutorial.

There used to be a dependency on the [Arduino Entropy Library](https://github.com/pmjdebruijn/Arduino-Entropy-Library) that needed to be downloaded separately, but it was causing memory errors due to how the Arduino suite includes files. I'll be breaking programs out into separate folders eventually, after which we'll reinstate the entropy library.

# Flashing your own programs

I made a guide on how Conway's Game of Life works on the KeebCard, which will hopefully help you write your own programs! you can check that out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3y9NNHXf2Y)

# Troubleshooting

Having successfully hand-soldered >30 of these now, I put the two most common problems people encounter in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7IxT4Zf5qs). If you're having issues take a look!

# Fabbing

If you want to make your own run of KeebCard boards, check out the GERBERS directory. These are gerbers produced by the standard settings in Kicad. They are confirmed to work with JLCPCB, but probably work just fine at a bunch of other board shops.
